1.Story Pitch

What impact does the climate crisis have on us? Each year, we witness examples that demonstrate the severity of the climate crisis, 
such as the 2022 California wildfires, the 2022 Pakistan floods that caused over 1,700 deaths, 
alpine ski resorts that may have to close due to melting glaciers.
However, these catastrophic events are not the only indicators of the seriousness of the climate crisis. 
We can easily understand the gravity of the situation just by looking at the production rates of the staple foods we consume daily, 
such as wheat, corn, and rice. Therefore, through this project, we aim to explore how the climate crisis is affecting our daily food and meals. 
By analyzing data such as rising sea temperatures, abnormal climate patterns, and crop production, 
we emphasize the importance of paying attention to the climate crisis and putting forth efforts to resolve it. 
This project is fascinating because it makes the issues of the climate crisis, which might have felt distant and disconnected from our lives, 
more vivid and realistic. 

2.Finding Data
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vagifa/worldwide-crop-production (21165 rows, 5 columns) 

This dataset comes from Kaggle is created by Vagif Aliyev. The dataset records crop yields of several types of crops and it spans decades. 

https://climatedata.imf.org/pages/climatechange-data (970 rows 53 columns) 

This dataset is collected from The Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) , Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) / Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), Brussels, Belgium – and it records the frequency of climate-related disasters. 

3.Background Research/Inspiration
Food is an essential resource for all living organisms. Humans cannot function long without the constant intake of nutrients into their body. 
These nutrients allow humans to function and continue with their daily lives. 
Food is an essential but scarce resource around the world, and the increase in climate change is causing more extremities in the weather pattern. 
These extremities in weather causes less than ideal conditions for the growth of crops and therefore leads to a lack in supply of these crops. 
The above paragraph clearly affirms the importance of this topic as well as shows the gravity of the situation. 
Given below are five URL’S which also tackle a similar topic. These URL’S will be analyzed in order to gain inspiration for the final project, 
while also displaying the contrasts between the mentioned URL and our project:

1.https://share.america.gov/how-climate-change-affects-food-crisis/ 

a.This article is relevant to our topic as it takes in factors such as abnormal climate factors such as, 
rainfall patterns, heatwaves and rising temperatures, which are all relevant to our own analysis.
b.The article however does not look into factors such as crop production. 
In addition to this it also focuses more on specific regions (namely Africa and US) rather than a more general consensus 
which is what our analysis will be based on. It also does not include a dataset taking into account potential factors which are relevant to the problem.

2.https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/12/climate-change-extreme-weather-food-shortages-rise-prices/ 

a.This article looks into a wider range of factors than the one mentioned above. 
In addition to this, it also visualizes the data through use of graphs which we would like to implement in our project as well.
b.This article also implements a more economic stance and talks about the influence of trade barriers affecting the circulation of crops around the world. 
While this is a prevalent issue in our world, it is not directly relevant to our topic and therefore shows a contrast between the project and the article.

3.https://www.epa.gov/climateimpacts/climate-change-impacts-agriculture-and-food-supply

a.This article was relevant as once again provides a comparison between the climate and food production. 
It talks about how food production is affected by climate change.
b.However, while it gives a good understanding about how we go about our project it focuses more on an agricultural and crop aspect.
It also looks more into the agricultural aspect and therefore is a bit different than what the project will tackle.

4.https://www.concernusa.org/story/climate-change-and-hunger/

a.The link above once again talks about the correlation between climate change and hunger. 
It factors in correlations between climate change and food production and therefore is relevant to our topic.
b.However, while this article clearly factors in valuable points, 
it is also tackling certain aspects such as the correlation with food waste and the nutritional value of the food, with climate change. 
In addition to this it also doesn’t include  analysis of the abnormal weather pattern, 
as well as the rising sea temperature and therefore looks into a slightly different aspect of the same issue.

a.This article is also relevant to our topic at hand as it has a specific section focused on how abnormal or extreme weather causes crop damage, 
therefore limiting the production of food and causing scarcity of food. This in turn causes hunger 
and therefore has similarities which are relevant to our topic.
b.While our topic is discussing the impact of the climate crisis on our daily food and meals, 
with a focus on rising sea temperatures, abnormal climate patterns, and crop production. 
On the other hand, the article above is discussing the causes and outcomes of food shortages and high prices, 
with a focus on recent events such as the war in Ukraine and extreme weather events like droughts and floods. 
Therefore there is a slight discrepancy in the two topics
