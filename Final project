carbon emission trend as well as the production of wheat over the last 30 years. Our main goal
was to find out the correlation between climate change and crop production. So what exactly is
our hypothesis? During the last 30 years there has been an overall drop in the carbon
emissions, which is great news for our planet! However at the same time there has also been an
overall drop in the production of wheat, which could lead to food shortage in the long run. This
clearly concludes that climate change has not had a direct impact on wheat production. While
on the other hand it is also important to note that other factors were not considered in this
analysis and they could have had an external effect on the wheat production as well. All in all,
we need to stay vigilant as the wheat production decrease could slowly cause a world wide food
shortage, and we must figure out the root cause of this"),
